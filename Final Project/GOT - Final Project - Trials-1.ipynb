      "A huge double-bladed battle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A valuable weapon …  “On your feet, Will,” Ser Waymar commanded.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“There’s no one here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I won’t have you hiding under a bush.”  Reluctantly, Will obeyed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on my first ranging.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We will find these men.” He glanced around.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Up the tree.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Be quick about it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Look for a fire.”  Will turned away, wordless.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was no use to argue.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The wind was moving.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It cut right through him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Soon his hands were sticky with sap, and he was lost among the needles.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, “Who goes there?” Will heard uncertainty in the challenge.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Others made no sound.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Will saw movement from the corner of his eye.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Pale shapes gliding through the wood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He turned his head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then it was gone.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Branches stirred gently in the wind, scratching at one another with wooden fingers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the words seemed to freeze in his throat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Perhaps he was wrong.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection on the snow, some trick of the moonlight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "What had he seen, after all?\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Will, where are you?” Ser Waymar called up.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Can you see anything?” He was turning in a slow circle, suddenly wary, his sword in hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He must have felt them, as Will felt them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was nothing to see.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Answer me!\n",
      "1\n",
      "Why is it so cold?”  It was cold.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It stood in front of Royce.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the trees.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Come no farther,” the lordling warned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His voice cracked like a boy’s.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The wind had stopped.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was very cold.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Other slid forward on silent feet.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Waymar met him bravely.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Dance with me then.” He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was a boy no longer, but a man of the Night’s Watch.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Other halted.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like ice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running cold along the metal.\n",
      "1\n",
      "For a heartbeat he dared to hope.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Three of them … four … five … Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Will had to call out.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was his duty.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And his death, if he did.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the silence.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The pale sword came shivering through the air.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Waymar met it with steel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Royce checked a second blow, and a third, then fell back a step.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet they made no move to interfere.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His blade was white with frost; the Other’s danced with pale blue light.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then Royce’s parry came a beat too late.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The young lord cried out in pain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Blood welled between the rings.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It steamed in the cold, and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Waymar’s fingers brushed his side.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His moleskin glove came away soaked with red.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake, and the words were mocking.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Waymar Royce found his fury.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“For Robert!” he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Other’s parry was almost lazy.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When the blades touched, the steel shattered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain of needles.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Blood welled between his fingers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Swords rose and fell, all in a deathly silence.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was cold butchery.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Will closed his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty.\n"

      "1\n",
      "In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Catelyn wished she could share his joy.\n",

      "But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs.\n",

      "1\n",
      "And he gives us no more notice than this?\n",
      "1\n",
      "How many in his party, did the message say?”  “I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Cersei and the children travel with them.”  “Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,” he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It is just as well.\n",
      "1\n",
      "That will give us more time to prepare.”  “The queen’s brothers are also in the party,” she told him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ned grimaced at that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was small love between him and the queen’s family, Catelyn knew.\n",

      "The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert’s cause, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them.\n",

      "He must be, what, five by now?”  “Prince Tommen is seven,” she told him.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "Please, Ned, guard your tongue.\n",

      "The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.”  Ned squeezed her hand.\n",

      "Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Cersei was furious.” He sighed deeply.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The boy is my namesake, did you know that?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robert Arryn.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am sworn to protect him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "How can I do that if his mother steals him away?”  “I will take him as ward, if you wish,” Ned said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lysa should consent to that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.”  “A generous offer, my friend,” the king said, “but too late.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Lord Tywin has already given his consent.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.”  “I have more concern for my nephew’s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,” Ned declared.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.” Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Ah, Ned,” he said, “you are still too serious.” He put a massive arm around Ned’s shoulders.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there’s no need for it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Come, walk with me.”  They started back down between the pillars.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The king kept his arm around Ned’s shoulder.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long.”  Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“For the joy of my company, surely,” he said lightly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“And there is the Wall.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Night’s Watch is a shadow of what it once was.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Benjen says—”  “No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,” Robert said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Wall has stood for what, eight thousand years?\n",
      "1\n",
      "It can keep a few days more.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I have more pressing concerns.\n",
      "1\n",
      "These are difficult times.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I need good men about me.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Men like Jon Arryn.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand of the King.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He will not be easy to replace.”  “His son …” Ned began.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,” Robert said brusquely.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No more.”  That took Ned by surprise.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The words came unbidden.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The title goes with the domain.”  “Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,” Robert said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I have this year to think of, and next.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.”  “In peace, the title is only an honor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Let the boy keep it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "For his father’s sake if not his own.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Surely you owe Jon that much for his service.”  The king was not pleased.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He took his arm from around Ned’s shoulders.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Jon’s service was the duty he owed his liege lord.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am not ungrateful, Ned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You of all men ought to know that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "But the son is not the father.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A mere boy cannot hold the east.” Then his tone softened.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Enough of this.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There is a more important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.” Robert grasped Ned by the elbow.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I have need of you, Ned.”  “I am yours to command, Your Grace.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Always.” They were words he had to say, and so he said them, apprehensive about what might come next.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robert scarcely seemed to hear him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Those years we spent in the Eyrie … gods, those were good years.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I want you at my side again, Ned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I want you down in King’s Landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody.” Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment as melancholy as a Stark.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And the people … there is no end of them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They all want something, money or land or justice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The lies they tell … and my lords and ladies are no better.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am surrounded by flatterers and fools.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It can drive a man to madness, Ned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Half of them don’t dare tell me the truth, and the other half can’t find it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ah, no, not truly, but …”  “I understand,” Ned said softly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robert looked at him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I think you do.\n",
      "1\n",
      "If so, you are the only one, my old friend.” He smiled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.”  Ned dropped to one knee.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for coming so far?\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He spoke with the king’s voice, commanded the king’s armies, drafted the king’s laws.\n",
      "1\n",
      "At times he even sat upon the Iron Throne to dispense king’s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise indisposed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was the last thing in the world he wanted.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Your Grace,” he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I am not worthy of the honor.”  Robert groaned with good-humored impatience.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If I wanted to honor you, I’d let you retire.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave.” He slapped his gut and grinned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?”  Ned knew the saying.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What the king dreams,” he said, “the Hand builds.”  “I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit.” He threw back his head and roared his laughter.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The echoes rang through the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Damn it, Ned,” the king complained.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You might at least humor me with a smile.”  “They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man’s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,” Ned said evenly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.”  “Come south with me, and I’ll teach you how to laugh again,” the king promised.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We were meant to rule together.\n",
      "1\n",
      "If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Well, it is not too late.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I have a son.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You have a daughter.\n",
      "1\n",
      "My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as Lyanna and I might once have done.”  This offer did surprise him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Sansa is only eleven.”  Robert waved an impatient hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Old enough for betrothal.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The marriage can wait a few years.” The king smiled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Now stand up and say yes, curse you.”  “Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,” Ned answered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He hesitated.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“These honors are all so unexpected.\n",
      "1\n",
      "May I have some time to consider?\n",
      "1\n",
      "I need to tell my wife …”  “Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.” The king reached down, clasped Ned by the hand, and pulled him roughly to his feet.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Just don’t keep me waiting too long.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am not the most patient of men.”  For a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding.\n",
      "1\n",
      "This was his place, here in the north.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He could feel the eyes of the dead.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They were all listening, he knew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And winter was coming.\n",
      "1\n",
      "JON   There were times—not many, but a few—when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.\n",

      "1\n",
      "A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon’s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that.\n",

      "Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And he was finding that he had a man’s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king’s offspring.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all.\n",

      "1\n",
      "She was as beautiful as men said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "The king was a great disappointment to Jon.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes.\n",

      "She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He decided she was insipid.\n",

      "A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls.\n",
      "1\n",
      "One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken.\n",

      "Ghost did not move.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He stood staring out in the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn softened then, to see his pain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon’s place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected.\n",

      "1\n",
      "His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“My lord,” he said to Ned, “pardon for disturbing your rest.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I have been left a message.”  Ned looked irritated.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Been left?\n",
      "1\n",
      "By whom?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Has there been a rider?\n",
      "1\n",
      "I was not told.”  “There was no rider, my lord.\n",

      "Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I napped.\n",
      "1\n",
      "My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king’s party.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We have had no other visitors from the south.”  “A wooden box, you say?” Catelyn said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.”  Ned frowned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A lens,” he said.\n",

      "“What has that to do with me?”  “I asked the same question,” Maester Luwin said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“A lens is an instrument to help us see.”  “Indeed it is.” He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal.\n",

      "Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What is it that they would have us see more clearly?”  “The very thing I asked myself.” Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve.\n",

      "1\n",
      "The furs dropped away from her nakedness, forgotten.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn.\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",

      "What was this message?”  Catelyn stiffened in his grasp.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A warning,” she said softly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If we have the wits to hear.”  His eyes searched her face.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Go on.”  “Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.”  His fingers tightened on her arm.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“By whom?”  “The Lannisters,” she told him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The queen.”  Ned released his hold on her arm.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There were deep red marks on her skin.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Gods,” he whispered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His voice was hoarse.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Your sister is sick with grief.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She cannot know what she is saying.”  “She knows,” Catelyn said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands.\n",
      "1\n",
      "To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.” Catelyn looked to her husband.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Now we truly have no choice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You must be Robert’s Hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You must go south with him and learn the truth.”  She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The only truths I know are here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.”  Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Hand of the King has great power, my lord.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn’s death, to bring his killers to the king’s justice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.”  Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn’s heart went out to him, but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then.\n",
      "1\n",
      "First the victory must be won, for her children’s sake.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You say you love Robert like a brother.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?”  “The Others take both of you,” Ned muttered darkly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He turned away from them and went to the window.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She did not speak, nor did the maester.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He never came home again.”  “A different time,” Maester Luwin said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A different king.”  “Yes,” Ned said dully.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He seated himself in a chair by the hearth.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Catelyn, you shall stay here in Winterfell.”  His words were like an icy draft through her heart.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No,” she said, suddenly afraid.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Was this to be her punishment?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Yes,” Ned said, in words that would brook no argument.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You must govern the north in my stead, while I run Robert’s errands.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robb is fourteen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Soon enough, he will be a man grown.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Make him part of your councils.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He must be ready when his time comes.”  “Gods will, not for many years,” Maester Luwin murmured.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Give my wife your voice in all things great and small.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Teach my son the things he needs to know.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Winter is coming.”  Maester Luwin nodded gravely.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What of the other children?”  Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Rickon is very young,” he said gently.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He should stay here with you and Robb.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The others I would take with me.”  “I could not bear it,” Catelyn said, trembling.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You must,” he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.”  Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart.\n",
      "1\n",
      "But not Bran.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Never Bran.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Yes,” she said, “but please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He is only seven.”  “I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,” Ned said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey.\n",
      "1\n",
      "That is not healthy.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran can bridge that distance.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert became mine.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Our House will be the safer for it.”  He was right; Catelyn knew it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It did not make the pain any easier to bear.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She would lose all four of them, then: Ned, and both girls, and her sweet, loving Bran.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn’t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry.\n",

      "He was still trying to decide on a name.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon’s wolf, the white one, was Ghost.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn’t white.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He hadn’t been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His wolf came sprinting at his heels.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You stay here,” he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lie down.\n",
      "1\n",
      "That’s right.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Now stay.”  The wolf did as he was told.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran looked back down.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A strange chill went through him.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Stay.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You’re worse than Mother.” The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran’s second home.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His mother often said that Bran could climb before he could walk.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true.\n",
      "1\n",
      "To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn’t even be sure what floor you were on.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It taught him Winterfell’s secrets too.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran knew about that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Even Maester Luwin didn’t know that, Bran was convinced.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He told her that he wouldn’t, but she never believed him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You’re not my son,” he told Bran when they fetched him down, “you’re a squirrel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "So be it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you.”  Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Since his father would not forbid it, she turned to others.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran was not impressed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There were crows’ nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran’s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, “I’m not made of clay.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And anyhow, I never fall.”  Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down.\n",

      "1\n",
      "You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn’t hear you overhead.\n",
      "1\n",
      "That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side.\n",
      "1\n",
      "From there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and then the crows would come round to see if you’d brought any corn.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“You’ll have to work at it every day.” He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and stepped back.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“How does it feel?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Do you like the balance?”  “I think so,” Arya said.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Who will I practice with?”  “You’ll find someone,” Jon promised her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“King’s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Run, and ride, make yourself strong.\n",

      "1\n",
      "They said it together.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“… don’t … tell … Sansa!”  Jon messed up her hair.\n",

      "“I will miss you, little sister.”  Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry.\n",

      "“I wish you were coming with us.”  “Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Who knows?” He was feeling better now.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was not going to let himself be sad.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I better go.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Does this have a name?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Oh, tell me.”  “Can’t you guess?” Jon teased.\n",
      "1\n",

      "The ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightening.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare’s milk and Illyrio’s fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany’s ears.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Viserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khal’s own bloodriders, but Dany could see the anger in her brother’s lilac eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they refused.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but she waved it all away.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was no one to talk to.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They had no common language.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She would even have welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am blood of the dragon, she told herself.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Drogo watched without expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The warriors were watching too.\n",
      "1\n",
      "One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Illyrio had told her that might happen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.”  Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then two men seized the same woman.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash.\n",
      "1\n",
      "No one made a move to interfere.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It ended as quickly as it began.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki’s waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As the loser died, the winner took hold of the nearest woman—not even the one they had been quarreling over—and had her there and then.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair,” he had said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again.\n",

      "Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce … and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dany gasped.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun.\n",
      "1\n",
      "One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Another was pale cream streaked with gold.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What are they?” she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Dragon’s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,” said Magister Illyrio.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.”  “I shall treasure them always.” Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never seen one, nor thought to see one.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that Illyrio could afford to be lavish.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The khal’s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons they were.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings.\n",

      "“This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, O blood of my blood, and I am but a woman.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Let my lord husband bear these in my stead.” And so Khal Drogo too received his “bride gifts.”  Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A handsome gift, Khaleesi,” Magister Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Most lucky.” The gifts mounted up around her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or use.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar.\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "There was something about her that took the breath away.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse’s neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says.”  “She’s beautiful,” Dany murmured.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal.”  Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she was used to.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dany sat there uncertain for a moment.\n",
      "1\n",
      "No one had told her about this part.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What should I do?” she asked Illyrio.\n",

      "It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Take the reins and ride.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You need not go far.”  Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Or perhaps it was for the first time ever.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, every eye upon them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The horse broke into a trot, and she smiled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dothraki scrambled to clear a path.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The slightest pressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She sent it into a gallop, and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They were hemmed in on either side, with no room to stop.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her head.\n",
      "1\n",
      "1\n",
      "Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and somehow it made her feel a little better.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the tone, a tenderness she had never expected from this man.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one.\n",
      "1\n",

      "It took a long time.\n",

      "All the while he sat there silently, watching her.\n",

      "When she was done, he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming.\n",

      "“Gods,” he swore, laughing, “it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride!\n",
      "1\n",
      "I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad.” He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain … I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I’m going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!”  Ned laughed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I will gladly light the torch for you.”  “Good man!” The king clapped him on the shoulder.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“What do you say, Ned?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer’s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.”  “Would that we could,” Ned said, “but we have duties now, my liege … to the realm, to our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We are not the boys we were.”  “You were never the boy you were,” Robert grumbled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“More’s the pity.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And yet there was that one time … what was her name, that common girl of yours?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Becca?\n",
      "1\n",
      "No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yours was … Aleena?\n",
      "1\n",
      "No.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You told me once.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Was it Merryl?\n",
      "1\n",
      "You know the one I mean, your bastard’s mother?”  “Her name was Wylla,” Ned replied with cool courtesy, “and I would sooner not speak of her.”  “Wylla.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yes.” The king grinned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You never told me what she looked like …”  Ned’s mouth tightened in anger.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Nor will I.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.”  “Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.”  “I had taken her to wife.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She was carrying my child.”  “You are too hard on yourself, Ned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You always were.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed.” He slapped a hand on his knee.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Well, I’ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you’re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.”  The rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A wide plain spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ned pointed them out to his king.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The barrows of the First Men.”  Robert frowned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Have we ridden onto a graveyard?”  “There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,” Ned told him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“This land is old.”  “And cold,” Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King’s Landing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Here.” The king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Varys the eunuch was the king’s master of whisperers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He served Robert now as he had once served Aerys Targaryen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, but the message did not concern Lady Arryn.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What is the source for this information?”  “Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?”  “Would that I might forget him,” Ned said bluntly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had dishonored the north.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king’s justice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Five years had passed since then.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,” Robert explained.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lord Varys makes good use of him.”  “So the slaver has become a spy,” Ned said with distaste.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He handed the letter back.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I would rather he become a corpse.”  “Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,” Robert said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Jorah aside, what do you make of his report?”  “Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.\n",
      "1\n",
      "What of it?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Shall we send her a wedding gift?”  The king frowned.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.” It was said that Rhaegar’s little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin’s soldiers had torn him from his mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The way your lord father died, that was unspeakable.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And Rhaegar … how many times do you think he raped your sister?\n",
      "1\n",
      "How many hundreds of times?” His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him.\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“The barbarians have no ships.\n",

      "“For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I know the boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.”  Ned was ready for that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Yet we still must have a Warden of the East.\n",
      "1\n",
      "If Robert Arryn will not do, name one of your brothers.\n",

      "Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm’s End, surely.”  He let the name hang there for a moment.\n",

      "1\n",
      "He looked uncomfortable.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“That is,” Ned finished quietly, watching, “unless you have already promised the honor to another.”  For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Just as quickly, the look became annoyance.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What if I have?”  “It’s Jaime Lannister, is it not?”  Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows.\n",

      "1\n",
      "A single hard word to end the matter.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Kingslayer,” Ned said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The rumors were true, then.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“An able and courageous man, no doubt,” he said carefully, “but his father is Warden of the West, Robert.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "No one man should hold both East and West.” He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,” the king said stubbornly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Don’t vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set.”  “Your Grace, may I speak frankly?”  “I seem unable to stop you,” Robert grumbled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They rode through tall brown grasses.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Can you trust Jaime Lannister?”  “He is my wife’s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.”  “As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen’s,” Ned pointed out.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Why should I mistrust him?\n",
      "1\n",
      "He has done everything I have ever asked of him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His sword helped win the throne I sit on.”  His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He swore a vow to protect his king’s life with his own.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then he opened that king’s throat with a sword.”  “Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!” Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If Jaime hadn’t done it, it would have been left for you or me.”  “We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,” Ned said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?”  “I won my crown there.\n",
      "1\n",
      "How should I forget it?”  “You took a wound from Rhaegar,” Ned reminded him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The remnants of Rhaegar’s army fled back to King’s Landing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We followed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I expected to find the gates closed to us.”  Robert gave an impatient shake of his head.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "What of it?”  “Not our men,” Ned said patiently.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lannister men.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And they had taken the city by treachery.”  The war had raged for close to a year.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Lords great and small had flocked to Robert’s banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, had remained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King’s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty.\n",
      "1\n",
      "So the mad king had ordered his last mad act.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had opened his city to the lions at the gate.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,” Robert said.\n",

      "It was no less than they deserved.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I shall not trouble my sleep over it.”  “You were not there,” Ned said, bitterness in his voice.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“I can’t leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be his last.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I have to be with him, if … if …” She took her son’s limp hand, sliding his fingers through her own.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robb’s voice softened.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He’s not going to die, Mother.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed.”  “And what if Maester Luwin is wrong?\n",
      "1\n",
      "What if Bran needs me and I’m not here?”  “Rickon needs you,” Robb said sharply.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He’s only three, he doesn’t understand what’s happening.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I don’t know what to do with him.” He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he’d done when he was little.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Mother, I need you too.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’m trying but I can’t … I can’t do it all by myself.” His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "Catelyn trembled, just for a second.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Bran’s.” Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The howling grew louder.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Don’t,” she told him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Bran needs to stay warm.”  “He needs to hear them sing,” Robb said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then a third, closer.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Shaggydog and Grey Wind,” Robb said as their voices rose and fell together.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You can tell them apart if you listen close.”  Catelyn was shaking.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Make them stop!” she cried.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I can’t stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!”  She didn’t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her, holding her in strong arms.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Don’t be afraid, Mother.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They would never hurt him.” He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Close your eyes,” he said gently.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Rest.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maester Luwin tells me you’ve hardly slept since Bran’s fall.”  “I can’t,” she wept.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Gods forgive me, Robb, I can’t, what if he dies while I’m asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies …” The wolves were still howling.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She screamed and held her ears again.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Oh, gods, close the window!”  “If you swear to me you’ll sleep.” Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Dogs,” he said, listening.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“All the dogs are barking.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They’ve never done that before …” Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When she looked up, his face was pale in the lamplight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Fire,” he whispered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Fire, she thought, and then, Bran!\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Help me,” she said urgently, sitting up.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Help me with Bran.”  Robb did not seem to hear her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The library tower’s on fire,” he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She sagged with relief.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran was safe.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Thank the gods,” she whispered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robb looked at her as if she’d gone mad.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Mother, stay here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’ll come back as soon as the fire’s out.” He ran then.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Outside, there were shouts of “Fire!” in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny of frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The direwolves had fallen silent.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then she closed the shutters.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You weren’t s’posed to be here,” he muttered sourly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No one was s’posed to be here.”  He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No,” she said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "He must have heard her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It’s a mercy,” he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He’s dead already.”  “No,” Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again.\n",

      "1\n",
      "There was much more than she’d asked for: hot bread, butter and honey and blackberry preserves, a rasher of bacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of mint tea.\n",

      "And with it came Maester Luwin.\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Do you have the answer yet?”  “Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,” Robb said, “afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of something he knows.”  Catelyn was proud of him.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“We must keep Bran safe.\n",

      "If there was one killer, there could be others.”  “How many guards do you want, m’lady?” Hal asked.\n",

      "“Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the bottom of the stairs.\n",
      "1\n",
      "No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother’s.”  “As you say, m’lord.”  “Do it now,” Catelyn suggested.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Yes,” Catelyn said.\n",

      "“Lady Stark,” Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, “did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used?”  “The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,” Catelyn replied with a dry smile.\n",

      "“Why do you ask?”  “We found the knife still in the villain’s grasp.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“All we have is conjecture.\n",
      "1\n",
      "This is the queen’s beloved brother we mean to accuse.\n",

      "She will not take it kindly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We must have proof, or forever keep silent.”  “Your proof is in the dagger,” Ser Rodrik said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.”  There was only one place to find the truth of it, Catelyn realized.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Someone must go to King’s Landing.”  “I’ll go,” Robb said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No,” she told him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Your place is here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.” She looked at Ser Rodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in his grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous.\n",

      "Who to send?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Who would be believed?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Then she knew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn struggled to push back the blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She climbed out of bed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I must go myself.”  “My lady,” said Maester Luwin, “is that wise?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion.”  “What about Bran?” Robb asked.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The poor boy looked utterly confused now.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You can’t mean to leave him.”  “I have done everything I can for Bran,” she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.”  “You will need a strong escort, my lady,” Theon said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I’ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,” Robb said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheel-houses.\n",

      "I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We will follow the White Knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King’s Landing well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters.” And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see.\n",

      "SANSA   Eddard Stark had left before dawn, Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The king sent for him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Another hunt, I do believe.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.”  “I’ve never seen an aurochs,” Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table.\n",

      "My poor prince.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Don’t be afraid.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you.” Tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest contempt.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Then go,” he spit at her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“And don’t touch me.”      EDDARD   “They’ve found her, my lord.”  Ned rose quickly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Our men or Lannister’s?”  “It was Jory,” his steward Vayon Poole replied.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“She’s not been harmed.”  “Thank the gods,” Ned said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "Tell Jory to bring her here at once.”  “I am sorry, my lord,” Poole told him.\n",

      "“The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She’s being taken directly before the king …”  “Damn that woman!” Ned said, striding to the door.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her voice may be needed.” He descended the tower steps in a red rage.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had led searches himself for the first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared.\n",
      "1\n",
      "This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with strength.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored them in his haste.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He would have run, but he was still the King’s Hand, and a Hand must keep his dignity.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was aware of the eyes that followed him, of the muttered voices wondering what he would do.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The castle was a modest holding a half day’s ride south of the Trident.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "Ser Raymun lived under the king’s peace, but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar’s dragon banners at the Trident, and his three older brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten.\n",
      "1\n",
      "With king’s men, Darry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions burned hot and heavy.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The king had appropriated Ser Raymun’s audience chamber, and that was where Ned found them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The room was crowded when he burst in.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Too crowded, he thought; left alone, he and Robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robert was slumped in Darry’s high seat at the far end of the room, his face closed and sullen.\n",

      "1\n",
      "It was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble.\n",

      "I ate some berries, but there was nothing else.”  “We’ll feed you soon enough,” Ned promised.\n",

      "“I had not thought you so niggardly.\n",

      "The king I’d thought to wed would have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down.”  Robert’s face darkened with anger.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“That would be a fine trick, without a wolf.”  “We have a wolf,” Cersei Lannister said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "A direwolf is a savage beast.\n",

      "Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Get her a dog, she’ll be happier for it.”  That was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her eyes were frightened as they went to her father.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He doesn’t mean Lady, does he?” She saw the truth on his face.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No,” she said.\n",

      "1\n",

      "“Do it yourself then, Robert,” he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“At least have the courage to do it yourself.”  Robert looked at Ned with flat, dead eyes and left without a word, his footsteps heavy as lead.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Silence filled the hall.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Where is the direwolf?” Cersei Lannister asked when her husband was gone.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Send for Ilyn Payne.”  “No,” Ned said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice.” The words tasted of bile in his throat, but he forced them out.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If it must be done, I will do it.”  Cersei Lannister regarded him suspiciously.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You, Stark?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Is this some trick?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Why would you do such a thing?”  They were all staring at him, but it was Sansa’s look that cut.\n",

      "That is the nature of my service.” He shrugged.\n",

      "“You do have the dagger with you, yes?”  Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.”  Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Blood welled, and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Careful,” Catelyn told him, “it’s sharp.”  “Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,” Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“Such sweet balance.\n",

      "You want to find the owner, is that the reason for this visit?\n",
      "1\n",
      "You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You should have come to me.”  “And if I had,” she said, “what would you have told me?”  “I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King’s Landing.” He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger, drew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It’s mine.”  “Yours?” It made no sense.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Petyr had not been at Winterfell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day,” he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court.” Petyr’s sheepish grin made him look half a boy again.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.”  “Who?” Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her fingers ached with remembered pain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Imp,” said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face.\n",

      "“Tyrion Lannister.”      JON   The courtyard rang to the song of swords.\n",

      "Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon’s chest as he pressed the attack.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he raised his sword, Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy’s leg and sent him staggering.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grenn’s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Enough!” Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grenn cradled his hand.\n",

      "“The bastard broke my wrist.”  “The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand.\n",

      "Or would have, if these blades had an edge.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It’s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.” Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.”  Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet.\n",

      "The frosty morning air felt good on his face.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“Try.” Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Maybe I had her a time or two.” He laughed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.\n",

      "He’d only taken the black after he’d lost an arm at the siege of Storm’s End.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Before that he’d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king’s brother.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He’d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he’d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles.\n",

      "They said it was Donal Noye who’d forged King Robert’s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He’d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he’d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“You’re no lordling.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Remember that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You’re a Snow, not a Stark.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You’re a bastard and a bully.”  “A bully?” Jon almost choked on the word.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“They were the ones who came after me.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Four of them.”  “Four that you’ve humiliated in the yard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Four who are probably afraid of you.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’ve watched you fight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It’s not training with you.\n",

      "Put a good edge on your sword, and they’d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You leave them nothing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You shame them.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "He did feel proud when he won.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Why shouldn’t he?\n",
      "1\n",
      "But the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“They’re all older than me,” he said defensively.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Older and bigger and stronger, that’s the truth.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Who was he, some old knight?”  “Ser Rodrik Cassel,” Jon said warily.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was a trap here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He felt it closing around him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon’s face.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Now think on this, boy.\n",
      "1\n",
      "None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley.\n",
      "1\n",
      "What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.” His look was grim.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?”  “Don’t call me that!” Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I never … I didn’t think …”  “Best you start thinking,” Noye warned him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Now go.”  By the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The sun had broken through the clouds.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Even after all these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky … but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“And beyond a doubt the most useless,” Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken.\n",
      "1\n",
      "This is the end of the world, it seemed to say.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "What are you doing in King’s Landing?\n",
      "1\n",
      "What’s happened?” Ned asked his wife.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Is it Bran?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Is he …” Dead was the word that came to his lips, but he could not say it.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Ned was lost.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Why are you here, my love?\n",
      "1\n",
      "What is this place?”  “Just what it appears,” Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A brothel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?” He smiled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King’s Landing.”  “Why?” Ned asked.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You’ve been hurt.” He took her hands in his own, turned them over.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Gods.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Those are deep cuts … a gash from a sword or … how did this happen, my lady?”  Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand.\n",

      "“I don’t hate Sansa,” she told him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Not truly.” It was only half a lie.\n",

      "I can be as strong as Robb.”  He held Needle out to her, hilt first.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Here.”  She looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "For a moment she was afraid to touch it, afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again, but then her father said, “Go on, it’s yours,” and she took it in her hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I can keep it?” she said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“If I took it away, no doubt I’d find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Try not to stab your sister, whatever the provocation.”  “I won’t.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I promise.” Arya clutched Needle tightly to her chest as her father took his leave.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The next morning, as they broke their fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for her pardon.\n",

      "Three days later, at midday, her father’s steward Vayon Poole sent Arya to the Small Hall.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The trestle tables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The hall seemed empty, until an unfamiliar voice said, “You are late, boy.” A slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose stepped out of the shadows, holding a pair of slender wooden swords.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Tomorrow you will be here at midday,” He had an accent, the lilt of the Free Cities, Braavos perhaps, or Myr.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Who are you?” Arya asked.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I am your dancing master.” He tossed her one of the wooden blades.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She grabbed for it, missed, and heard it clatter to the floor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Tomorrow you will catch it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Now pick it up.”  It was not just a stick, but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding it out in front of her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was heavier than it looked, much heavier than Needle.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The bald man clicked his teeth together.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“That is not the way, boy.\n",
      "1\n",
      "This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You will take the blade in one hand.”  “It’s too heavy,” Arya said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A hollow inside is filled with lead, just so.\n",

      "One hand now is all that is needing.”  Arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants.\n",

      "The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which can upset the digestion.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him.”  “I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.”  The Grand Maester’s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.”  “Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?”  Pycelle wrinkled his brow.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon’s spirits.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His love was fierce to see.”  “Was there nothing else?\n",
      "1\n",
      "No final words?”  “When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Just before he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The seed is strong, he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Death did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He never spoke again.”  Ned took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn’s death?”  “Unnatural?” The aged maester’s voice was thin as a whisper.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No, I could not say so.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sad, for a certainty.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon Arryn rests easy now, his burdens lifted at last.”  “This illness that took him,” said Ned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?”  “Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,” Pycelle replied.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys’s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I have seen more of illness than I care to remember, my lord.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I will tell you this: Every case is different, and every case is alike.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Lord Jon’s death was no stranger than any other.”  “His wife thought otherwise.”  The Grand Maester nodded.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife.\n",
      "1\n",
      "If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.”  “So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?”  “I am,” Pycelle replied gravely.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?”  “Poison,” Ned suggested quietly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A disturbing thought.\n",
      "1\n",
      "We are not the Free Cities, where such things are common.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt.” He fell silent for a moment, his eyes lost in thought.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Every hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And the Hand was loved by all.\n",
      "1\n",
      "What sort of monster in man’s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?”  “I have heard it said that poison is a woman’s weapon.”  Pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It is said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Women, cravens … and eunuchs.” He cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phlegm onto the rushes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Above them, a raven cawed loudly in the rookery.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Put not your trust in spiders, my lord.”  That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about Varys that made his flesh crawl.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I will remember that, Maester.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And I thank you for your help.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I have taken enough of your time.” He stood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door.\n",
      "1\n",

      "The Night’s Watch”—he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping—“or this.”  Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once.\n",

      "1\n",
      "The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father’s eye she named it rape, so here he is.\n",

      "One by one the rest fell in line.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required.\n",

      "At the end they had all agreed … all but Rast.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You girls do as you please,” Rast said, “but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I’m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon.” He laughed in Jon’s face and left them there.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon could hear Rast’s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The direwolf’s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy’s throat, just enough to draw blood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Remember, we know where you sleep,” Jon said softly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved.\n",
      "1\n",
      "From that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet Sam remained unhurt.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A few nights later, at Jon’s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp’s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool.\n",
      "1\n",
      "One night he visited Jon in his cell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I don’t know what you did,” he said, “but I know you did it.” He looked away shyly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I’ve never had a friend before.”  “We’re not friends,” Jon said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "The tome was over a century old.\n",

      "Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths.\n",

      "1\n",
      "A water dancer sees with all her senses, she reminded herself.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out with her hands.\n",

      "Huge stones had been set into the curving walls as steps, circling down and down, dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And something was coming up out of the darkness, out of the bowels of the earth …  Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“The gods alone know,” the first voice said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch, writhing like a snake as it rose.\n",
      "1\n",

      "From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, its torches no brighter than candles.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Snow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable hidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet it nestled against the Giant’s Lance in such a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower waycastle.\n",
      "1\n",
      "An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire, but Mya declined.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“We ought to keep going, my lady,” she said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If it please you.” Catelyn nodded.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Again they were given fresh mules.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Hers was white.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Mya smiled when she saw him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Whitey’s a good one, my lady.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to be careful.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He’ll kick if he doesn’t like you.”  The white mule seemed to like Catelyn; there was no kicking, thank the gods.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was no ice either, and she was grateful for that as well.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began,” Mya told her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It was always white above here, and the ice never melted.” She shrugged.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I can’t remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way once, in the olden times.”  So young, Catelyn thought, trying to remember if she had ever been like that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The girl had lived half her life in summer, and that was all she knew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Winter is coming, child, she wanted to tell her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The words were on her lips; she almost said them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Perhaps she was becoming a Stark at last.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky.\n",
      "1\n",
      "As they climbed, Catelyn found it was better to look up than down.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It’s best to lead the mules over,” she said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.”  Catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead; twenty feet long and close to three feet wide, but with a precipitous drop to either side.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She could hear the wind shrieking.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Mya stepped lightly out, her mule following as calmly as if they were crossing a bailey.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was her turn.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its jaws.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She stopped, trembling, afraid to move.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over the edge.\n",

      "1\n",
      "A stocky, silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn’s household guard.\n",

      "Beside him stood Maester Colemon, thin and nervous, with too little hair and too much neck.\n",

      "She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived.”  “I hope she had a good night’s rest,” Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to go unnoticed.\n",
      "Ser Jorah Mormont said, “The Western Market will have food more to your taste, Your Grace.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The traders from the Free Cities come there to sell their wares.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The khal will honor his promise in his own time.”  “He had better,” Viserys said grimly.\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Your brother should have bided his time in Pentos.\n",

      "There is no place for him in a khalasar.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms.”  Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "Someone stronger?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms?”  Ser Jorah’s face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“When I first went into exile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians, as wild as their horses.\n",
      "1\n",
      "If you had asked me then, Princess, I should have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki.”  “But if I asked you now?”  “Now,” the knight said, “I am less certain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they are full as deadly … and there are so many of them, my lady.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar.”  “Is that truly so many?”  “Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident,” Ser Jorah admitted, “but of that number, no more than a tenth were knights.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The rest were archers, freeriders, and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When Rhaegar fell, many threw down their weapons and fled the field.\n",
      "1\n",
      "How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood?\n",
      "1\n",
      "How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?”  “Not long,” she said, “not well.”  He nodded.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The riders have no taste for siegecraft.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle …”  “Is he?” Dany asked.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A fool, I mean?”  Ser Jorah considered that for a moment.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Robert should have been born Dothraki,” he said at last.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Usurper would agree.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He is a strong man, brave … and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field.\n",
      "1\n",
      "But the men around him, well, their pipers play a different tune.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His brother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark …” He spat.\n",

      "1\n",
      "The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children.”  Khal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans from Yi Ti and Asshai and the Shadow Lands came to trade, with the Mother of Mountains looming overhead.\n",

      "“The purse is just a taste, my friend.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Your wishes are not my concern.\n",

      "“A cold night,” he said casually, “and the High Hall is so drafty.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I don’t wish to catch a chill.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Mord, if you would be so good, fetch my cloak.”  The gaoler squinted at him, face dull with suspicion.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My cloak,” Tyrion repeated.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping.\n",

      "You recall.”  “Get him the damnable cloak,” Ser Vardis said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future retribution, yet he went for the cloak.\n",

      "When he draped it around his prisoner’s neck, Tyrion smiled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My thanks.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I shall think of you whenever I wear it.” He flung the trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder, and felt warm for the first time in days.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lead on, Ser Vardis.”  The High Hall of the Arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches, burning in the sconces along the walls.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-falcon sewn on her breast in pearls.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Since she did not look the sort to join the Night’s Watch, Tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mourning clothes were appropriate garb for a confession.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her long auburn hair, woven into an elaborate braid, fell across her left shoulder.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The taller throne beside her was empty; no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie was off shaking in his sleep.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tyrion was thankful for that much, at least.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He bowed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Lady Arryn had summoned her knights and retainers to hear his confession, as he had hoped.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He saw Ser Brynden Tully’s craggy face and Lord Nestor Royce’s bluff one.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Beside Nestor stood a younger man with fierce black sidewhiskers who could only be his heir, Ser Albar.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Most of the principal houses of the Vale were represented.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tyrion noted Ser Lyn Corbray, slender as a sword, Lord Hunter with his gouty legs, the widowed Lady Waynwood surrounded by her sons.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Others sported sigils he did not know; broken lance, green viper, burning tower, winged chalice.\n",
      "1\n",

      "Marillion the singer had found a new woodharp.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tyrion smiled; whatever happened here tonight, he did not wish it to happen in secret, and there was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the rear of the hall, Bronn lounged beneath a pillar.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The freerider’s black eyes were fixed on Tyrion, and his hand lay lightly on the pommel of his sword.\n",

      "“What will we gain by the dwarf’s death?\n",

      "“When the Kingslayer receives the Imp’s head, it will be a warning to him.”  Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Murder Lord Jon, that is?\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Imp still denies it, and most fiercely …”  “I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn,” Catelyn replied, “but whether it was Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say.” Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell, but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer … perhaps because the dwarf was here, while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep, hundreds of leagues to the south.\n",

      "The Kingslayer, now … I have no great liking for the man, but he’s not the sort.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Was it poison, my lady?”  Catelyn frowned, vaguely uneasy.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“How else could they make it look a natural death?” Behind her, Lord Robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the other in half, spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She glanced at her nephew and sighed.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering, you know … oh, but I’m speaking out of turn.” The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester’s chain.\n",

      "Ned chose each word with care.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“With those wounds … terrible wounds … there should be blood all over.\n",

      "1\n",
      "They wrapped the dead men in cloaks, but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with its hooves, even biting at Ketter when he ran to help.\n",

      "The rangers had no better luck with the other garrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was well past midday by the time they started back.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "He was dripping wet from the neck down, steaming in the chill air.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",

      "“He’ll find giants then, or they’ll find him.\n",
      "1\n",

      "They’ve been known to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet.\n",

      "“But you don’t know what I mean, do you, boy?”  “Yes I do,” Bran insisted.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He understood about mating; he had seen dogs in the yard, and watched a stallion mount a mare.\n",
      "1\n",
      "But talking about it made him uncomfortable.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“Go dress.”  “Hodor.” He walked back the way he had come, ducking under a low-hanging tree limb.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was awfully big, Bran thought as he watched him go.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“Giants and worse than giants, Lordling.\n",

      "The Western Market was a great square of beaten earth surrounded by warrens of mud-baked brick, animal pens, whitewashed drinking halls.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Hummocks rose from the ground like the backs of great subterranean beasts breaking the surface, yawning black mouths leading down to cool and cavernous storerooms below.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The interior of the square was a maze of stalls and crookback aisles, shaded by awnings of woven grass.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "She reached across his table and touched his hair.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You are my firstborn, Robb.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world, red-faced and squalling.”  He rose, clearly uncomfortable with her touch, and walked to the hearth.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Grey Wind rubbed his head against his leg.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor.\n",

      "Have you had any word of your sisters?”  “There was a letter,” Robb said, scratching his direwolf under the jaw.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“One for you as well, but it came to Winterfell with mine.” He went to the table, rummaged among some maps and papers, and returned with a crumpled parchment.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“This is the one she wrote me, I never thought to bring yours.”  Something in Robb’s tone troubled her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She smoothed out the paper and read.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Concern gave way to disbelief, then to anger, and lastly to fear.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“This is Cersei’s letter, not your sister’s,” she said when she was done.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The real message is in what Sansa does not say.\n",
      "1\n",
      "All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating her … I know the sound of a threat, even whispered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They have Sansa hostage, and they mean to keep her.”  “There’s no mention of Arya,” Robb pointed out, miserable.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No.” Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I had hoped … if you still held the Imp, a trade of hostages …” He took Sansa’s letter and crumpled it in his fist, and she could tell from the way he did it that it was not the first time.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Is there word from the Eyrie?\n",
      "1\n",
      "I wrote to Aunt Lysa, asking help.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Has she called Lord Arryn’s banners, do you know?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Will the knights of the Vale come join us?”  “Only one,” she said, “the best of them, my uncle … but Brynden Blackfish was a Tully first.\n",
      "1\n",
      "My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate.”  Robb took it hard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Mother, what are we going to do?\n",
      "1\n",
      "I brought this whole army together, eighteen thousand men, but I don’t … I’m not certain …” He looked to her, his eyes shining, the proud young lord melted away in an instant, and quick as that he was a child again, a fifteen-year-old boy looking to his mother for answers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It would not do.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What are you so afraid of, Robb?” she asked gently.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "The Greatjon says that won’t matter if we catch him with his breeches down, but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister won’t be so easily surprised.”  “Good,” she said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She could hear echoes of Ned in his voice, as he sat there, puzzling over the map.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Tell me more.”  “I’d leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin, archers mostly, and march the rest down the causeway,” he said, “but once we’re below the Neck, I’d split our host in two.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“There’s no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford, where Robert won his crown.\n",

      "Not until the Twins, all the way up here, and Lord Frey controls that bridge.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Again like his father; Ned would always take the more dangerous task himself.\n",

      "“How did you … what sort of magician are you?”  “A thirsty one,” Varys said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Is this the same poison they gave Robert?”  “You wrong me,” Varys said sadly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Truly, no one loves a eunuch.\n",

      "Give me the skin.” He drank, a trickle of red leaking from the corner of his plump mouth.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night of the tourney, but no more poisonous than most,” he concluded, wiping his lips.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Here.”  Ned tried a swallow.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "She came to court a few days ago to plead that you be spared.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A pity you couldn’t have been there, you would have been touched.” He leaned forward intently.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I trust you realize that you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?”  “The queen will not kill me,” Ned said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His head swam; the wine was strong, and it had been too long since he’d eaten.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Cat … Cat holds her brother …”  “The wrong brother,” Varys sighed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“And lost to her, in any case.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She let the Imp slip through her fingers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I expect he is dead by now, somewhere in the Mountains of the Moon.”  “If that is true, slit my throat and have done with it.” He was dizzy from the wine, tired and heartsick.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Your blood is the last thing I desire.”  Ned frowned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“When they slaughtered my guard, you stood beside the queen and watched, and said not a word.”  “And would again.\n",
      "1\n",

      "Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen.”  Winter is coming.\n",

      "The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My lord,” he asked hesitantly, “it’s said there was a bird last night …”  “There was.\n",
      "1\n",
      "What of it?”  “I had hoped for some word of my father.”  “Father,” taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont’s shoulders.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Father.”  The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped up on his head, fluttered its wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Grief and noise,” Mormont grumbled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“That’s all they’re good for, ravens.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Why I put up with that pestilential bird … if there was news of Lord Eddard, don’t you think I would have sent for you?\n",

      "Bastard or no, you’re still his blood.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "It seems he’s been removed from the Kingsguard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now Selmy’s wanted for treason.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped.” Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of men who’d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne,” he said in disgust.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The raven laughed shrilly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Boy, boy, boy, boy.”  Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear’s best hope, Jon remembered; if he had fallen, what chance was there that Mormont’s letter would be heeded?\n",
      "1\n",
      "He curled his hand into a fist.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Pain shot through his burned fingers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What of my sisters?”  “The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls.” He gave an irritated shrug.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Perhaps they never got my letter.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Aemon sent two copies, with his best birds, but who can say?\n",

      "More like, Pycelle did not deign to reply.\n",

      "I fear we count for less than nothing in King’s Landing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They tell us what they want us to know, and that’s little enough.”  And you tell me what you want me to know, and that’s less, Jon thought resentfully.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war, yet no word of that had been breathed to him … save by Samwell Tarly, who’d read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret, all the time saying how he shouldn’t.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Doubtless they thought his brother’s war was none of his concern.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It troubled him more than he could say.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Robb was marching and he was not.\n",
      "1\n",
      "No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now, with his new brothers on the Wall, he still felt craven.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Corn,” the raven was crying.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Corn, corn.”  “Oh, be quiet,” the Old Bear told it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Snow, how soon does Maester Aemon say you’ll have use of that hand back?”  “Soon,” Jon replied.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Good.” On the table between them, Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You’ll be ready for this, then.”  The raven flapped down and landed on the table, strutting toward the sword, head cocked curiously.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon hesitated.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had no inkling what this meant.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My lord?”  “The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Well, dry leather and old wood, what could you expect?\n",
      "1\n",
      "The blade, now … you’d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade.” Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I had the rest made anew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Take it.”  “Take it,” echoed his raven, preening.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Take it, take it.”  Awkwardly, Jon took the sword in hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His left hand; his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf’s head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a “bastard sword.” Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“This is Valyrian steel, my lord,” he said wonderingly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It is,” the Old Bear told him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It was my father’s sword, and his father’s before him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black.”  He is giving me his son’s sword.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Jon could scarcely believe it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The blade was exquisitely balanced.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Your son—”  “My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah’s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The original pommel was a bear’s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable.\n",
      "1\n",
      "For you, I thought a white wolf more apt.\n",

      "“Who will.”  Truly, the gods had heard Jon’s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man’s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood.\n",

      "Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames.\n",
      "1\n",

      "That should get young Joffrey’s attention, I’d think … and Ser Alliser’s a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.”  “Crow.” Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“As well,” the Lord Commander continued, ignoring the bird’s protest, “it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke.” He jabbed a finger up at Jon’s face.\n",

      "She heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier, and poured it over his wounds.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Khal Drogo cursed her, but he did not move.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She bound the arrow wound with a plaster of wet leaves and turned to the gash on his breast, smearing it with a pale green paste before she pulled the flap of skin back in place.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The khal ground his teeth together and swallowed a scream.\n",

      "“Before,” Dany said to the ugly Lhazareen woman, “I heard you speak of birthing songs …”  “I know every secret of the bloody bed, Silver Lady, nor have I ever lost a babe,” Mirri Maz Duur replied.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My time is near,” Dany said.\n",
      "1\n",

      "“Moon of my life, you do not ask a slave, you tell her.\n",

      "The stallions call, this place is ashes.\n",

      "There, beside his pavilion, Lord Tywin took his evening meal with his chief knights and lords bannermen, his great crimson-and-gold standard waving overhead from a lofty pike.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Not too many, I wouldn’t want to be greedy.” He filled his wine cup and watched a serving man carve into the pig.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The crisp skin crackled under his knife, and hot juice ran from the meat.\n",

      "“What’s that, m’lord?” Shae murmured against him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Nothing,” he told her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A song I learned as a boy, that’s all.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Go to sleep, sweetling.”  When her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady, Tyrion slid out from beneath her, gently, so as not to disturb her sleep.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Naked, he crawled outside, stepped over his squire, and walked around behind his tent to make water.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bronn was seated cross-legged under a chestnut tree, near where they’d tied the horses.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He was honing the edge of his sword, wide awake; the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Where did you find her?” Tyrion asked him as he pissed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I took her from a knight.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The man was loath to give her up, but your name changed his thinking somewhat … that, and my dirk at his throat.”  “Splendid,” Tyrion said dryly, shaking off the last drops.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I seem to recall saying find me a whore, not make me an enemy.”  “The pretty ones were all claimed,” Bronn said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I’ll be pleased to take her back if you’d prefer a toothless drab.”  Tyrion limped closer to where he sat.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My lord father would call that insolence, and send you to the mines for impertinence.”  “Good for me you’re not your father,” Bronn replied.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I saw one with boils all over her nose.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Would you like her?”  “What, and break your heart?” Tyrion shot back.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I shall keep Shae.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Did you perchance note the name of this knight you took her from?\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’d rather not have him beside me in the battle.”  Bronn rose, cat-quick and cat-graceful, turning his sword in his hand.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You’ll have me beside you in the battle, dwarf.”  Tyrion nodded.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The night air was warm on his bare skin.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“See that I survive this battle, and you can name your reward.”  Bronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left, and tried a cut.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Who’d want to kill the likes of you?”  “My lord father, for one.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He’s put me in the van.”  “I’d do the same.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A small man with a big shield.\n",
      "1\n",
      "You’ll give the archers fits.”  “I find you oddly cheering,” Tyrion said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I must be mad.”  Bronn sheathed his sword.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Beyond a doubt.”  When Tyrion returned to his tent, Shae rolled onto her elbow and murmured sleepily, “I woke and m’lord was gone.”  “M’lord is back now.” He slid in beside her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her hand went between his stunted legs, and found him hard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Yes he is,” she whispered, stroking him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from, and she named the minor retainer of an insignificant lordling.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You need not fear his like, m’lord,” the girl said, her fingers busy at his cock.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He is a small man.”  “And what am I, pray?” Tyrion asked her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A giant?”  “Oh, yes,” she purred, “my giant of Lannister.” She mounted him then, and for a time, she almost made him believe it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tyrion went to sleep smiling …  … and woke in darkness to the blare of trumpets.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Shae was shaking him by the shoulder.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“M’lord,” she whispered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Wake up, m’lord.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’m frightened.”  Groggy, he sat up and threw back the blanket.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The horns called through the night, wild and urgent, a cry that said hurry hurry hurry.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He heard shouts, the clatter of spears, the whicker of horses, though nothing yet that spoke to him of fighting.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My lord father’s trumpets,” he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Battle assembly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I thought Stark was yet a day’s march away.”  Shae shook her head, lost.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her eyes were wide and white.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Groaning, Tyrion lurched to his feet and pushed his way outside, shouting for his squire.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Wisps of pale fog drifted through the night, long white fingers off the river.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Men and horses blundered through the predawn chill; saddles were being cinched, wagons loaded, fires extinguished.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The trumpets blew again: hurry hurry hurry.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled their sword belts as they ran.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he found Pod, the boy was snoring softly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with his toe.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My armor,” he said, “and be quick about it.” Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already armored and ahorse, wearing his battered halfhelm.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Do you know what’s happened?” Tyrion asked him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Stark boy stole a march on us,” Bronn said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He crept down the kingsroad in the night, and now his host is less than a mile north of here, forming up in battle array.”  Hurry, the trumpets called, hurry hurry hurry.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“See that the clansmen are ready to ride.” Tyrion ducked back inside his tent.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Where are my clothes?” he barked at Shae.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“There.\n",
      "1\n",
      "No, the leather, damn it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bring me my boots.”  By the time he was dressed, his squire had laid out his armor, such that it was.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tyrion owned a fine suit of heavy plate, expertly crafted to fit his misshapen body.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Alas, it was safe at Casterly Rock, and he was not.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had to make do with oddments assembled from Lord Lefford’s wagons: mail hauberk and coif, a dead knight’s gorget, lobstered greaves and gauntlets and pointed steel boots.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Some of it was ornate, some plain; not a bit of it matched, or fit as it should.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His breastplate was meant for a bigger man; for his oversize head, they found a huge bucket-shaped greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Shae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If I die, weep for me,” Tyrion told the whore.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“How will you know?\n",
      "1\n",
      "You’ll be dead.”  “I’ll know.”  “I believe you would.” Shae lowered the greathelm down over his head, and Pod fastened it to his gorget.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Tyrion buckled on his belt, heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk.\n",
      "1\n",
      "By then his groom had brought up his mount, a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as he was.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He needed help to mount; he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Pod handed him up his shield, a massive slab of heavy ironwood banded with steel.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Lastly they gave him his battle-axe.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Shae stepped back and looked him over.\n",
      "We’ve seen a few of his outriders, but those that saw us did not live to tell of it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He ought to have sent out more.\n",

      "1\n",
      "He would hold the fly inside his huge fist long enough to hear its frantic buzzing.\n",

      "Beneath his painted vest, a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud covered the wound on his breast.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "Mirri Maz Duur’s poultice had itched and burned, and he had torn it off six days ago, cursing her for a maegi.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The mud plaster was more soothing, and the herbwomen made him poppy wine as well.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He’d been drinking it heavily these past three days; when it was not poppy wine, it was fermented mare’s milk or pepper beer.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet he scarcely touched his food, and he thrashed and groaned in the night.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dany could see how drawn his face had become.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Rhaego was restless in her belly, kicking like a stallion, yet even that did not stir Drogo’s interest as it had.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when he woke from his troubled sleep.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And now this silence.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was making her afraid.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Since they had mounted up at dawn, he had said not a word.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When she spoke, she got no answer but a grunt, and not even that much since midday.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off robbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn’t have been scared off if she’d had a battle-axe.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Often as not, she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And she could dig for roots in the forest, even run down some rabbits.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the city, the only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs.\n",

      "1\n",
      "She had learned to keep to the center of the street.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see them coming.\n",
      "1\n",
      "If you walked near the buildings, people grabbed you.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In some alleys you couldn’t help but brush against the walls; the buildings leaned in so close they almost met.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A whooping gang of small children went running past, chasing a rolling hoop.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Arya stared at them with resentment, remembering the times she’d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She wondered how big Rickon had grown, and whether Bran was sad.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her “little sister” and muss her hair.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Not that it needed mussing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She’d seen her reflection in puddles, and she didn’t think hair got any more mussed than hers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street, hoping to make a friend who would give her a place to sleep, but she must have talked wrong or something.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The little ones only looked at her with quick, wary eyes and ran away if she came too close.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn’t answer, called her names, and tried to steal from her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It made her think of the sea.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maybe that was the way out.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maybe Arya could do that too.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She decided to visit the riverfront.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway, and she hadn’t checked that one today.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side by side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Half the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Out on the Blackwater, three of the king’s war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way along the river.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin, her heart almost stopped in her chest.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The sight of Winterfell's colors brought tears to her eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Behind them, a sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her moorings.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Arya could not read the name painted on the hull; the words were strange, Myrish, Braavosi, perhaps even High Valyrian.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Please,” she said, “what ship is this?”  “She’s the Wind Witch, out of Myr,” the man said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“She’s still here,” Arya blurted.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The longshoreman gave her a queer look, shrugged, and walked away.\n",

      "Arya ran toward the pier.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home … still waiting!\n",

      "She’d imagined it had sailed ages ago.\n",

      "Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his hand on the pommel of his sword.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, she stopped to rub at her eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Her eyes her eyes her eyes, why did …  Look with your eyes, she heard Syrio whisper.\n",

      "“There they forged the Pact.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“So long as the kingdoms of the First Men held sway, the Pact endured, all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms, yet finally there came a time, many centuries later, when other peoples crossed the narrow sea.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Andals were the first, a race of tall, fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests.\n",

      "Only here, where the King in the North threw back every army that tried to cross the Neck, did the rule of the First Men endure.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and added his voice to his brother’s, dread clutched at Bran’s heart.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It’s coming,” he whispered, with the certainty of despair.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had known it since last night, he realized, since the crow had led him down into the crypts to say farewell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had known it, but he had not believed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He had wanted Maester Luwin to be right.\n",

      "The crow, he thought, the three-eyed crow …  The howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Summer padded across the tower floor to Shaggydog, and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of his brother’s neck.\n",
      "1\n",
      "From the window came a flutter of wings.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened its beak, and gave a harsh, raucous rattle of distress.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and clattered on the floor.\n",

      "Bran pulled him close and hugged him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maester Luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He rose, slow as a sleepwalker, and moved to the window.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he whistled, the raven hopped onto his bandaged forearm.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There was dried blood on its wings.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A hawk,” Luwin murmured, “perhaps an owl.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Poor thing, a wonder it got through.” He took the letter from its leg.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Bran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What is it?” he said, holding his brother all the harder.\n",

      "1\n",
      "The dishes piled up on the table beneath her window, untouched and spoiling, until the servants took them away again.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless, and she woke from it more tired than when she had closed her eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet those were the best times, for when she dreamed, she dreamed of Father.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Waking or sleeping, she saw him, saw the gold cloaks fling him down, saw Ser Ilyn striding forward, unsheathing Ice from the scabbard on his back, saw the moment … the moment when … she had wanted to look away, she had wanted to, her legs had gone out from under her and she had fallen to her knees, yet somehow she could not turn her head, and all the people were screaming and shouting, and her prince had smiled at her, he’d smiled and she’d felt safe, but only for a heartbeat, until he said those words, and her father’s legs … that was what she remembered, his legs, the way they’d jerked when Ser Ilyn … when the sword …  Perhaps I will die too, she told herself, and the thought did not seem so terrible to her.\n",

      "If she flung herself from the window, she could put an end to her suffering, and in the years to come the singers would write songs of her grief.\n",

      "His visor had been removed from his helm, to better show his dour face; pouchy bags under his eyes, a wide sour mouth, rusty hair spotted with grey.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "“His Grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room.”  “Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come?”  “Are you refusing to come, my lady?” The look he gave her was without expression.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“Yes … but you are no true knight, Ser Meryn.”  Sandor Clegane would have laughed at that, Sansa knew.\n",

      "1\n",
      "The climb was something out of a nightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of ankle-deep mud, and there were more steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror waiting on the ramparts.\n",
      "1\n",
      "From the high battlements of the gatehouse, the whole world spread out below them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sansa could see the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s hill, where her father had died.\n",
      "1\n",
      "At the other end of the Street of the Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins of the Dragonpit.\n",

      "To the west, the swollen red sun was half-hidden behind the Gate of the Gods.\n",

      "1\n",
      "Yet she knew that beyond them was open country, farms and fields and forests, and beyond that, north and north and north again, stood Winterfell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What are you looking at?” Joffrey said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“This is what I wanted you to see, right here.”  A thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart, reaching as high as Sansa’s chin, with crenellations cut into it every five feet for archers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The heads were mounted between the crenels, along the top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sansa had noted them the moment she’d stepped out onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He can make me look at the heads, she told herself, but he can’t make me see them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“This one is your father,” he said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“This one here.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dog, turn it around so she can see him.”  Sandor Clegane took the head by the hair and turned it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve it longer.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sansa looked at it calmly, not seeing it at all.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It did not really look like Lord Eddard, she thought; it did not even look real.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“How long do I have to look?”  Joffrey seemed disappointed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Do you want to see the rest?” There was a long row of them.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If it please Your Grace.”  Joffrey marched her down the wallwalk, past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I’m saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly,” he explained.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her father.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Despite the tar, most were long past being recognizable.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The king pointed to one and said, “That’s your septa there,” but Sansa could not even have told that it was a woman.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The jaw had rotted off her face, and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane, although she supposed she had known all along.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Why did you kill her?” she asked.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“She was god-sworn …”  “She was a traitor.” Joffrey looked pouty; somehow she was upsetting him.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You haven’t said what you mean to give me for my name day.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maybe I should give you something instead, would you like that?”  “If it please you, my lord,” Sansa said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "When he smiled, she knew he was mocking her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Your brother is a traitor too, you know.” He turned Septa Mordane’s head back around.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I remember your brother from Winterfell.\n",
      "1\n",
      "My dog called him the lord of the wooden sword.\n",

      "Didn’t you, dog?”  “Did I?” the Hound replied.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I don’t recall.”  Joffrey gave a petulant shrug.\n",

      "“Leave me.\n",
      "1\n",
      "All of you.”  Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a look.\n",

      "“Not you, Tyrion.\n",
      "1\n",

      "1\n",
      "He drank.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“You have the right of it about Stark.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert’s brothers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Dead …” His hand curled into a fist.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Madness.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Rank madness.”  “Joff’s only a boy,” Tyrion pointed out.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“At his age, I committed a few follies of my own.”  His father gave him a sharp look.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a whore.”  Tyrion sipped at his wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Our position is worse than you know,” his father went on.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It would seem we have a new king.”  Ser Kevan looked poleaxed.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A new—who?\n",
      "1\n",
      "What have they done to Joffrey?”  The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin’s thin lips.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Nothing … yet.\n",
      "1\n",
      "My grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now he has claimed the crown.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The bride’s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.”  “Those are grave tidings.” When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My daughter commands us to ride for King’s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers.” His mouth tightened.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Commands us, mind you.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the name of the king and council.”  “How is King Joffrey taking the news?” Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,” Lord Tywin said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself.”  “With what army?” Tyrion asked.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You don’t plan to give him this one, I hope?”  “He talks of leading the City Watch,” Lord Tywin said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“If he takes the Watch, he’ll leave the city undefended,” Ser Kevan said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone …”  “Yes.” Lord Tywin looked down at his son.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.”  “Why, Father,” said Tyrion, “that almost sounds like praise.” He leaned forward intently.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“What of Stannis?\n",
      "1\n",
      "He’s the elder, not Renly.\n",
      "1\n",
      "How does he feel about his brother’s claim?”  His father frowned.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Yet he does nothing.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Oh, Varys hears his whispers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai.\n",
      "1\n",
      "What does it mean?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Is any of it true?” He gave an irritated shrug.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Kevan, bring us the map.”  Ser Kevan did as he was bid.\n",

      "1\n",
      "He looked worn and tired, battered by battle and haggard from strain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn hugged him fiercely.\n",

      "1\n",
      "“When we heard about Lord Eddard … the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance.”  “Will that bring Ned back to me?” she said sharply.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The wound was still too fresh for softer words.\n",
      "1\n",
      "She could not think about Ned now.\n",

      "1\n",
      "When had that good man grown so old and grey?\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He instructed me to bring you to him at once.”  “I’ll take her.” Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them.\n",
      "1\n",

      "Edmure’s look was somber.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He will not be with us long, the maesters say.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The pain is … constant, and grievous.”  A blind rage filled her, a rage at all the world; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa, at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from her.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You should have told me,” she said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You should have sent word as soon as you knew.”  “He forbade it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying.\n",
      "1\n",
      "With the realm so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was …”  “… they might attack?” Catelyn finished, hard.\n",

      "If you had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf …  They climbed the spiral stair in silence.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster’s solar was triangular as well, with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great sandstone ship.\n",
      "1\n",
      "From there the lord of the castle could look down on his walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They had moved her father’s bed out onto the balcony.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,” Edmure explained.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Father, see who I’ve brought.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Cat has come to see you …”  Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew older.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Even his face sagged.\n",
      "1\n",
      "The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Now they had gone white as snow.\n",
      "1\n",
      "His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure’s voice.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Little cat,” he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“My little cat.” A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I watched for you …”  “I shall leave you to talk,” her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow before he withdrew.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Catelyn knelt and took her father’s hand in hers.\n",
      "1\n",
      "It was a big hand, but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from it.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“You should have told me,” she said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“A rider, a raven …”  “Riders are taken, questioned,” he answered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Ravens are brought down …” A spasm of pain took him, and his fingers clutched hers hard.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The crabs are in my belly … pinching, always pinching.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Day and night.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They have fierce claws, the crabs.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Maester Vyman makes me dreamwine, milk of the poppy … I sleep a lot … but I wanted to be awake to see you, when you came.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I was afraid … when the Lannisters took your brother, the camps all around us … I was afraid I would go, before I could see you again … I was afraid …”  “I’m here, Father,” she said.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“With Robb, my son.\n",
      "1\n",
      "He’ll want to see you too.”  “Your boy,” he whispered.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“He had my eyes, I remember …”  “He did, and does.\n",
      "1\n",
      "And we’ve brought you Jaime Lannister, in irons.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Riverrun is free again, Father.”  Lord Hoster smiled.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I saw.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Last night, when it began, I told them … had to see.\n",
      "1\n",
      "They carried me to the gatehouse … watched from the battlements.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Ah, that was beautiful … the torches came in a wave, I could hear the cries floating across the river … sweet cries … when that siege tower went up, gods … would have died then, and glad, if only I could have seen you children first.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Was it your boy who did it?\n",
      "1\n",
      "Was it your Robb?”  “Yes,” Catelyn said, fiercely proud.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“It was Robb … and Brynden.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Your brother is here as well, my lord.”  “Him.” Her father’s voice was a faint whisper.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“The Blackfish … came back?\n",
      "1\n",
      "From the Vale?”  “Yes.”  “And Lysa?” A cool wind moved through his thin white hair.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Gods be good, your sister … did she come as well?”  He sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“No.\n",
      "1\n",
      "I’m sorry …”  “Oh.” His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“I’d hoped … I would have liked to see her, before …”  “She’s with her son, in the Eyrie.”  Lord Hoster gave a weary nod.\n",
      "1\n",
      "“Lord Robert now, poor Arryn’s gone … I remember … why did she not come with you?”  “She is frightened, my lord.\n",
      "1\n",
      "In the Eyrie she feels safe.” She kissed his wrinkled brow.\n",

      "The Greatjon sat at Robb’s left hand, and then Theon Greyjoy; Galbart Glover and Lady Mormont were to the right of Catelyn.\n",
